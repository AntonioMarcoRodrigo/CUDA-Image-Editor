0) Install opencv
		https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html
		
1) Modify PATH variable of the system to include 
	OPENCV_DIR/bin
	
2) Visual Studio configuration:
	C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories
	Add the directories with libraries: OPENCV_DIR/build/include
	
	Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories
	Add the directories with libraries: OPENCV_DIR/build/x64/vcXX/lib  (XX version of Visual: 15, 17...)
	
	Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies
	If Release mode write:
		opencv_core2413.lib , opencv_imgproc2413.lib, opencv_highgui2413.lib
	If Debug mode write:
		opencv_core2413d.lib , opencv_imgproc2413d.lib, opencv_highgui2413d.lib
		
	Configuration Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories
	Add OPENCV_DIR/build/include where OPENCV_DIR is the folder of unpacked OpenCV
	
3) Visual Studio parameters (2 parameters, in image and out image)
	PX -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Command Arguments
	Add in and out image (example: Mars_Rover.jpg MarsConverted.png)
	(In image must be inside PX folder)
	
	
4) Open PX.sln to open the Visual Studio solution

5) According to Additional Dependencies (step 2) run Visual Studio in Debug mode or Release mode,
and execute (ctrl+F5)

6) Result image should appear alonside In image (inside PX folder)

7) In order to choose operations and its values, go to func.cu Line 512 "Operations". You can only chose one operation at a time. 
Set the desired operation to "true" and set the rest to "false"
A bit down, you can choose the values for each operation. Change them to desired values.
(Example: I want to increase the brightness of the image by 100:
 bool b_brightness = true; the rest = false; int brightnessAmount = 100;)
 
Possible operations:
1. Convolution filters
2. Brightness
3. Legacy Contrast
4. Contrast
5. Saturation
6. Tint
7. Color inversion
8. Flip Horizontal
9. Flip Vertical
10.  Salt & pepper noise
